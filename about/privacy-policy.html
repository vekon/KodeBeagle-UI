<h1>KodeBeagle Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>KodeBeagle strongly believes that the protection of individuals' privacy is a critical issue when doing business
    via the Internet. We have created this policy to inform our website visitors and plugin users of the measures we
    employ to keep private and confidential the information they may choose to share with us.</p>

<p>KodeBeagle does collect some kinds of information from its website/plugin users. By using this website/plugin unless
    opted out of anonymous stats collection, you agree to allow us to collect the kinds of information described later
    on this page, and to use it in the ways described.</p>

<p>Should we ever need to change this policy, we will post the changes on this page.</p>

<h2>Handling of Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

<p>On KodeBeagle website/plugin, we store information about you ONLY after you have given us permission to do so.</p>

<p>By clicking the accept button confirming your approval with the terms of this privacy policy (where applicable), you
    grant to KodeBeagle express consent to gather and process your system information (Beagle-ID, OS information and Intellij
    version). You can opt out for this information tracking.</p>

<p>KodeBeagle may use the information collected via this website/plugin with your approval only in order to (i) process
    your search query and/or (ii) to help improve our products and/or (iii) to provide you with information
    concerning KodeBeagle product licences, services, events and news and/or KodeBeagle is entitled to use this
    system information for the purposes specified above anywhere in our international organization, i.e. it can be rendered
    to KodeBeagle' controlling person or KodeBeagle' affiliates
    (for example, information collected by our Indian headquarters may be shared with one of our offices in the
    United States and vice versa).</p>


<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<p> KodeBeagle includes a universal unique identifier number known as Beagle-ID. This ID and information about your installation
    (for example, the operating system type, intellij version number and search queries) may be sent to KodeBeagle when you install
    plugin. We use Beagle-ID to improve search experience or to tailor our information offerings or responses according to the way
    you use the website/plugin. </p>

<p>We do not collect any personal information on our servers nor do we send user-end code on our
    servers for processing. The processing of keywords takes place on the plugin locally. These keywords
    are references to libraries <em>external</em> to the projects. These are send as part of the query to our
    servers. There is a way to exclude user defined library by clicking settings icon on the plugin and
    configuring exclude imports. Deciding which library is external and should be included in search is
    automatic and user configurable both.</p>

<h2>Data Protection</h2>

<p>KodeBeagle takes precautions to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the information we collect via our
    website/plugin. We employ the latest data security technologies to keep your information as safe as modern
    networking technology can make it.</p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>

<p>You can opt-out your approval concerning the use of your personal information and anonymous search logging from KodeBeagle plugin
    settings at any time. </p>

<h2>Inquiries and Feedback</h2>
